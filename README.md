# homework-2-responsive-portfolio

In the second assignement for the Gerogia Tech Bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a responsive portfolio. This portfolio would be one of the first tools we used to showcase our work and growth within the program. This assigment built on much of what we have learned already (HTML & CSS), and also introduced the tool Bootstrap. Without any starter code, we were expected to create a portfolio that had an _about page_, _portfolio page_ and a _contact page_. Given a fair amount of freedom towards the createive design I had many ideas running through my head before starting - BUT then thats when the coding started. 

Initially, I was overwhelmed with the prospect of working with a blank HTML doc; but I remembered that bootstrap is our best FRIEND. Immidiately, I searched for and picked a _navigation bar_ that I would grow to love. This nav bar gave me the confidence to find a _card_ element to use as my content container. 

Now we're cooking with grease!
