# homework-2-responsive-portfolio

In the second assignment for the Georgia Tech web development Bootcamp, we were tasked with creating a responsive portfolio. This portfolio would be one of the first tools we use to showcase our work and growth within the program. This assignment built on much of what we have learned already (HTML & CSS), and also introduced the tool Bootstrap. Without any starter code, we were expected to create a portfolio that had an _about page_, _portfolio page_ and a _contact page_. Given a fair amount of freedom towards the creative design I had many ideas running through my head before starting - BUT then thats when the challenges coding began. 

Initially, I was overwhelmed with the prospect of working with a blank HTML doc; but I remembered that bootstrap is our best FRIEND. Immediately, I searched and picked a _navigation bar_ that I would grow to love. This nav bar gave me the confidence to find a _card_ component to use as my content container. With the pre established responsiveness oo both the nav bar and the card I was ready to make sure that the nav bar was on all 3 of my portfolio pages.

Now we're cooking with grease!

Once the nav bar was on all three html pages I was now ready to focus on getting my place holder images on my portfolio page (don't have images ready to share yet), as well as my contact form on my contact page. 

The most interesting of these two tasks was the contact form - I was able to find a nice form on W3schools. Here I observed the code and pulled in both the html and css. With a few changes in the CSS I was ready to go. 

The last thing I focus on was the use of a media query on my about page. Changing the background color and card component position at a max length would help display my query. I battled with this for some time but finally got it right. 

As I prepared to submit my assignment I ran into trouble with getting my Github pages to link to my project. Unfortunately as I write this I still now, I have yet to figure this out. My assignment has both the git hub repo URL and the deployed application URL - however the deployed application URL is not linking to my website. 

All in all, with these challenges I faced, I experienced some wins and losses. I am ready to look back at this assignment and fix where I have made some mistakes. But nonetheless I am proud of my progress. 

On to the next challenge!
